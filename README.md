# IMC_DigitalInnovations

I wanted to thank you so much for the resources that were provided with the project. Absolutely blown away with the content that was shared and I feel I have already learned so much. I will be dedicating a lot of time digging into items discussed and referenced. =]

I also wanted to thank you for this opportunity, writing this project was quite the learning opportunity for me because there are a lot of tools I work with but have never had to implement. I also learned I am indecisive with which sort of client I wanted to use - I think I went through about 5 versions until I realized I had to buckle down and just choose one. Definitely need to practice creating more apps from scratch vs working in existing tech.
